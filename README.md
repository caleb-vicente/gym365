Gym365 is a mobile application for android :iphone: that manages your workout routines. With this application you can maintain and customize your exercises indicating number of repetitions, sets, etc.. 

Also, if you are a lover of the outdoors, a functionality of routes was generated. In this functionality you will be able to keep track of routes that you liked in the past and the speed at which you ran them thanks to the interactive maps.
